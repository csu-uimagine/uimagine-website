## **Description**

[EduGrowth](http://www.edugrowth.com.au/about-us/ "EduGrowth Website") was set up to help establish and develop an Educational Technology community to help drive innovation in the sector. The six founding partners were Charles Sturt University, Deakin University, Griffith University, La Trobe University, Monash University and Navitas. 

## **Aims**

The aim of EduGrowth is to drive the fact that Australia has the expertise and ambition to become a world leader in the business of education. With this belief comes a bold ambition to see 100 million learners educated globally per annum, by 2025, through Australia education. To achieve this there is a need to to grow the Australia EdTech community, building a national network across the education sector and advocate for EdTech.

uImagine is leading the engagement with EduGrowth for CSU. 

## **Approach**

As active participants in the community we have been engaged with the startup community in particular, developing our network and a better understanding of the community within Australia. 

Our plan is to partner with these companies and work towards mutually beneficial outcomes. 

## **Outcomes**

So far uImagine has bought a number of new technologies to our staff with the aim of running supported trials of these tools. These include our [Zeetings Trial](projects/zeetings-trial.html).
