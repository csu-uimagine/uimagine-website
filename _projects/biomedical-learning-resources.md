## Decription

Lucy Webster of the School of Biomedical Sciences lead a collaborative project with uImagine in which subjects across three schools within the Faculty of Science trialled the use of the [BEST Network](https://www.best.edu.au/) biomedical image database along with the [Smart Sparrow](https://www.smartsparrow.com/) adaptive learning tool. Students benefited greatly from the ability to access a wide range of microscopic biomedical images in the context of self-paced learning resources helping them to build their conceptual understandings of key anatomical or physiological material.

Membership to the [BEST Network](https://www.best.edu.au/) provides CSU with access to courseware tools that allow the creation of rich, interactive and adaptive. It also gives CSU access to the world class SLICE medical Image Bank.

## Aims

The aim of the project was to provide:

* Access to rich, interactive and adaptive courseware.
* Online tools that allow access to virtual lab environments and imaging resources
* Access to SLICE – a premium cloud-based biomedical image bank.
* Access to the Smart Sparrow authoring system to create adaptive learning resources.

## Findings

Access to the BEST Network provided incredibly useful online resources for staff and students to aid them in their teaching and learning. Access to the network also provided a chance to trial [Smart Sparrow](https://www.smartsparrow.com/) for the authoring of learning resources. The tool has now been adopted into a supported technology for the whole university.
