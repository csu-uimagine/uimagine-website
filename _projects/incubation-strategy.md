## **Description**

The Incubation Strategy was created as a plan to encourage and enable innovation and new ideas. The concept was to develop a pipeline for new ideas, technologies, pedagogies and practices in online learning. The strategy's aim was to provide a direction for future activities for uImagine to target specific areas that needed to be addressed to enhance our capabilities.

## **Aims**

The strategy would provide direction for future uImagine work and provide scope for areas to target and provide support.

## **Approach**

The document was developed by the uImagine team through broad consultation across the University. External experience in this area was provided by Peter Adams who was bought in to consult on the project and help to facilitate a number of the staff consultation sessions.

## **Findings/Outcomes**

The Strategy identified a range of innovation and incubation activities designed to achieve the following four key objectives:

* Foster a Community of Innovation in online learning that involves our sta  and students, businesses, education providers and local communities. Create a network for various stakeholders from within CSU and external partners to create a community around innovation that engages our talented community of sta  and students which make them part of an innovation process within CSU that creates opportunities to harness their skills and knowledge.
* Establish processes to develop our own Creative Solutions to the issues faced in online learning and teaching. Provide opportunities and methods of stimulating, capturing and seeking out new ideas around online learning within CSU. Identify the kinds of problems in online learning that need to be solved to improve student learning and teaching experience.
* Promote the Adoption and Adaption of new technologies and practices in online learning. Nurture and support new ideas and technologies for possible uptake by a broader audience. Evaluate ideas by creating opportunities to pilot and trial new technologies and practices.
* Develop Future Pathways for projects beyond the incubation stage. Promote ideas and practices developed within CSU to a broader audience and provide channels for communicating and sharing ideas. Scale Up ideas by developing pathways for future development, mainstreaming, commercialisation and growth of viable technologies, systems and practices

These areas have helped define uImagine's ongoing role and future projects.
