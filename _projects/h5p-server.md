## Description

[H5P](http://www.h5p.org) is a new and open sourced tool for developing online interactive learning resources. To help academics, educational designers and learning technologist utilise the tool we are setting up a server to house these resources. By bringing the technology inside CSU we are able to maintain and support the use of the tool and track it's use and growth. 

## Aims

To provide access to the suite of tools that H5P makes available. These can be used by staff across CSU and can be maintained by a range of staff. 

## Approach

The site uses a Wordpress Multisite installation to house all the content. New users can request a site be set up for their subject and then they can go in and develop and play with the tools that H5P provides.

## Outcomes

The site was made available at the beginning of 2018 and it will run for the next 12-18 months before a review is undertaken. During this time a number of trials and pilots can be run to assess the tool and if it will should become a support learning technology within CSU.
