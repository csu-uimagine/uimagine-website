## Description

This online course is designed to help learners anywhere at anytime to explore what it means to learn online, and develop the skills you need to make online learning a success. It will support the development of positive skills, habits and attitudes with online learning in order to confidently embrace taking an online subject - even an entire online degree!

## Aims

The course is purposefully generic - in other words it is not focused on a particular learning platform or one way of doing something online. It will introduce learners to a variety of tools for a multitude of academic purposes. In doing so a range of mobile and digital technologies will be explored. Once basic material and understandings are covered the modules take learners deeper into different online learning experiences. They will use and choose a variety of tools to support learning objectives and understand through hands on activities the potential of online learning as a bridge to successful study. Participants are encouraged to be creative and share, online of course, ideas and creations.

## Approach

The course is run using the Open Learning platform to allow students without any CSU credentials to access the course.
