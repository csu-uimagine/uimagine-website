## Description

The Introduction to Ecotourism is a short online course aimed at providing a taste of the broader area of study at CSU. The course is run through the Open Learning platform and uses a number of its features to develop an interactive course of study to create a community of students.

## Aims

Ecotourism is the fastest growing sector of the tourism industry. It has the potential to build local economies, provide opportunities for cultural exchange and encourage sustainable development in tourism. The course aims to create a community of like-minded students to explore what ecotourism is all about, engage in critical discussion and build your knowledge. Throughout the course students build a brief business plan for an ecotourism enterprise to provide them with a authentic tangible outcome that will help them develop an understanding of the field.

## Approach

The course is run using the Open Learning platform to allow students without any CSU credentials to access the course.
