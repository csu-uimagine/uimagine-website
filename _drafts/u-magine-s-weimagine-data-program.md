The [u!magine team](http://uimagine.edu.au/about/team/ "u!magine team") partnered with the Adaptive Learning & Teaching Services (ALTS) team of the Learning Technologies Unit to explore the ways that data can be used to support learning and teaching in higher education. The _weimagine:Data_ program consisted of a number of face-to-face and online lectures, workshops, panel discussions and demo sessions which ran over a period of six weeks where visiting professors and learning analytics experts, members of the Wagga and broader Riverina community, and CSU academic and professional staff came together to:

* explore the range of data sources available to inform teaching and learning in higher education;
* examine how different approaches to learning analytics can influence the way we 'see' and 'use' data;
* discuss and debate issues or concerns regarding ethics and big data as they relate to learning, e.g., surveillance, capitalism, privacy, exploitation, identity, to name a few;
* identify digital technologies to support academics' interrogation of the learning data to better understand students' learning experiences and their teaching practice;
* discover ways students can use data to inform their learning journey; and
* showcase examples of learning analytics in practice.

The _weimagine:Data_ program was opened in the CSU Engineering building on Bathurst campus by Dr. Bart Rienties, Professor of Learning Analytics at the Institute of Educational Technology of the Open University UK. Bart discussed his experience with learning analytics data and findings from large-scale implementations involving over 200,000+ students across a range of contexts including The Open University UK. Key takeaways included they ways  instructional design can be optimised using the principles of learning analytics, and the extent to which can learning analytics can promote ‘personalisation’ or ‘generalisation’ for diverse populations of students.
