Last week I attended the 43rd [Improving University Teaching Conference](http://www.iutconference.com/)  held on the Charles Sturt University Port Macquarie campus. As an  international conference it attracted representatives from Australia,  Scotland, China, South Africa, USA, Canada, Fiji and more..... This was a  small and very friendly event and over the three main days I did three  presentations - each one with a slightly different format.

This  post focuses on the 'Paper presentation' which was a 45 minute session  where I talked about my topic based on a slideshow, and then we had  discussion and questions in the room. The outcome of this session is an  academic paper (yet to be finalised!). Here are some essential artefacts  to learn from in the meantime. Thanks to Judy O'Connell for tweeting  this out during the session!

**Abstract**

When  designing online learning consideration should be given to how a  community can be built around subject content and objectives and how  students will interact with the academic and with each other. The  institutional learning management system affords a safe and reliable  albeit often less than inspiring space for learning. New digital  learning environments using the affordances of Web 2.0 technologies  support connected and collaborative pedagogies. Holistic approaches with  a focus on multimodal design extends learning into online spaces for  improved engagement, provision for response choices (text, audio,  video), online publishing and media creation while fostering new  pedagogical approaches.

**Essential Discussion**

This  session shared research-based holistic implementation of Web 2.0 tools  (tools that allow for multimodal communication, interaction and  collaboration as well as online publishing and media creation), or the  ‘collaboration web’ (Harasim, 2017) as a design feature for online  subjects in higher education. Emerging pedagogies based on participatory  and collaborative online learning were examined with current examples  of learning space design using Web 2.0 tools shared via the Case Study  of INF537 - Digital Futures Colloquium. This is the capstone subject I  co-wrote and teach at Charles Sturt University as part of the [Master of Education degree in Knowledge Networking and Digital Innovation](http://futurestudents.csu.edu.au/courses/teaching-education/master-education-knowledge-networks-digital-innovation).

These three essential understandings frame the presentation content:

1. Subject  and learning design in conjunction with management of Web 2.0 tools is  crucial. There needs to be a pedagogical purpose for each tool and  transparency around why and how each tool is implemented. Design must  respect student time and workflow, and not all activities may be  mandatory.
2. Teacher  presence in conjunction with online agility and flexibility is a key  factor. The ideal approach is for academics to be in the online spaces  with the students. Teacher presence is the glue that holds this holistic  approach together.
3. Open  scholarship in conjunction with networked and digital learning should  be the norm when using Web 2.0 tools. Leaving a digital legacy is a goal  afforded by Web 2.0 tools. It can be exciting to see where the learning  grows and interconnects with others beyond the class (experts, peers  etc.).

Harisim  shares how Web 2.0 has  drawn attention to online social communication  and collaboration and the invention and adoption of social networks that  marks the keystone for Web 2.0. (Harasim, 2017). The overall  instructional design and active facilitation including the selection of  effective tools and design of meaningful assignments is the best use of  Web 2.0 tools (Koehler, Newby & Ertmer, 2017). According to  McLoughlin and Lee (2010), pedagogical change requires knowledge of  appropriate teaching methods and awareness of the learner experience  while using Web 2.0 technologies and social media.

Veletsianos  (2016) believes that sociocultural factors make technologies and  practices emergent. Participatory technologies like online social  networks and blogging have become an integral part of open scholarship.  However, he questions what effect online socialisation with peers via  social networking sites might have for online learners, as well as the  pedagogical affordances of these sites. Tensions between Web 2.0 use and  educational practice in higher education are shared in research by  Bennett, Bishop, Dalgarno, Waycott and Kennedy (2012) where more  successful outcomes saw alignment between educational and Web 2.0  practices and highlighted the potential learning benefits from effective  use, through student content creation and sharing. Lock and Johnson  (2016) discuss the need for careful consideration of technology to  support student completion of collaborative learning tasks, and at the  higher education level students should be empowered to make those  decisions. Kuit and Fell (2010) found that constructivism underpins the  use of Web 2.0 technologies, and the role of the academic in this  process is pertinent to foster judgement, synthesis, research and  collaborative practices.

As  part of the INF537 Case Study discussion one of the tools shared is  FlipGrid. This is a vital communication and collaboration tool that has  recently been bought out by Microsoft. Kudos to [FlipGrid creators](https://flipgrid.com/) for  their inspiration and we will wait to see what MS does with the tool -  so far it has been made FREE to educators but with the implementation of  a mandatory password on each Grid. My thoughts about that as an  educational imposition will be shared in a subsequent blog post.....

Meanwhile you can access the [INF537 FlipGrid](https://flipgrid.com/055e20) where students discuss preliminary ideas for their Research Assignment.  Password is INF537-17
