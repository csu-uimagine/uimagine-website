## Description

Each School was required to report against these KPIs in 2016. A QLT (Online) academic lead was put in place to work in each of the new Faculties, and provide support though professional learning, regular sharing of practice through this site, a ‘quality check’ process and feedback.

Reaching, and surpassing these standards was a shared responsibility. Heads of School are ultimately responsible for most of the standards, but this is shared with the QLT leads, QA officers and discipline peers for particular standards. And of course, little can be achieved without the efforts of individual academics.
