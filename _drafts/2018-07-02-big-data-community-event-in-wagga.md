**Is Big Data the future, the solution or the problem?**

This was the question posed to community representatives in the agriculture, health, transportation and IT industries. On April 11, 2018 [u!magine](http://uimagine.edu.au/ "Visit u!magine website") held its first community event in Wagga Wagga. The [Wagga Wagga City Council](https://www.wagga.nsw.gov.au/ "WWCC") donated the space and Pennie Scott, Editor at Large of the [_Wagga Weekly_](https://www.yourlocalwaggaweekly.com.au/ "Wagga Weekly"), moderated the panel discussion. Participants were encouraged to ask questions and respond to comments through the creative use of [_Zeetings_](https://www.zeetings.com/ "Find out about Zeetings") (an interactive presentation tool), and those who could not attend in person were able to watch the [livestream](https://livestream.com/uimagine/data-community "View community event on Livestream").

Results of the poll asking the audience to answer the question being asked of the panel

The audience were also asked to contribute to a word cloud activity by sharing one word they would use to describe what they believed to be the biggest issue or concern regarding ethics and big data. 52% of the audience identified privacy issues as their greatest concern, followed by security, control, confidentiality, lack of regulation, integrity and transparency, to name a few.

The concluding question asked of the panel and audience was, “How would you like to see data being used for good in your organisation?”. Responses included:

* To help support global understanding of the use of data
* Easily accessible outside office/onsite jobs
* To support better learning and student agency
* To advocate for positive communities
* Evidence based evaluation of processes and their fitness for purpose
* To help people
* Right service for the right business using ABS data
* The base for evidence based analysis to improve efficiencies, lower costs and target new opportunity
* To empower employees and customers
* Careful compilation through lens of ethics
* Improve educational activities
* Better stock control and ability to create promotions
* Delivery of high quality of service, shorter waiting times, better self services
* To enrich the lives of the community, enhance liveable and amenity

Evaluations from the 60 participants were all positive and indicated a good interest for our next event on technology and its impacts on various industries in the Riverina, as captured by one participant:

> “It was a super event - great to see good numbers and a high level of engagement from the audience! I loved the mix of presenters and the way they stuck to the topic of data. Technology use was also great. I think the work u!magine is doing is setting a high-quality bar for other areas of the Wagga CSU campus to engage with the community - together we have so much knowledge to share to promote positive change with these collaborations.”
