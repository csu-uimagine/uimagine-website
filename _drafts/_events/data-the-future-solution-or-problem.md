    Deb is a fifth generation grazier, at Sunnybrae, Mundarlo on the Murrumbidgee River. Deb and her husband, Prof. John Blackwell, specialise in native grass fed Charolais – Red Poll cross beef. They also own Pentland Wines, vineyard at Yenda, NSW, where they specialise in only one French grape variety, Petit Verdot.  Working in isolated locations whilst competing commercially within a global market requires a great reliance upson technology and a source of accurate data.  From weather predictions to beef markets and wine trends, our daily lives are intrinsically reliant upon global data.  Keeping up with these trends, is complex and difficult, as well as potentially risky from a security and privacy perspective.

    Deb is a past Chairman of the Livestock Health and Pest Authority, where her interest was in the pursuit of a sound Bio Security regime for Australia. Deb has a BA LLB from the University of Sydney and is involved in charity fundraising and maintains a strong interest in agri politics and environmental health.

From Agriculture to Logistics, Health to Communications, data is fundamentally changing how we do things – from making decisions, caring for one another, working with the environment and doing business around the world. The proliferation of digital data has changed many aspects of our lives, but it's still a mystery into how it really works, how it's being used and how it could be used into the future. uImagine assembled a panel of local experts keen to share what data means to them, how it’s being used in their industry and what the future might hold.

Our panel session was ran by Pennie Scott and included:

* Deb Blackwell – Agriculture
* David Bardos  – Logistics
* James Howell – Information Technology
* Dr Tim Caton – Health.
