u!magine has divided it's work into three main areas:

1. **Incubation** - Encourages the exploration and development of new ideas.
2. **Innovation** - Implements changes new technologies, practices and pedagogies.
3. **Open Education** - Aims to open up access to learning and explore new horizons.

These three areas cover a range of work from hosting events and discussions, small scale trials and professional development, through to development and roll out of large scale pilots and trials.

We've collected our work together so that you can explore all the related events and projects.
