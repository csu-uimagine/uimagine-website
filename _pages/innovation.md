u!magine was established to drive innovative in online learning and teaching at Charles Sturt University. Starting with the [Destination 2020]() project that outlined the vision for CSU's future direction, uImagine has helped to shape and drive innovation. The [Online Learning Model]() was then developed to address one of the key concerns and indicators of quality online learning - engagement. The [pilots]() and [scale up]() followed and helped develop a range of strategies that could be implemented across courses across the university. These were collected in the [Online Learning Exchange]() which has been used as a key tool for professional development, learning design and to showcase innovative practices at the university.

To encourage innovation at the grass-roots level a range of academic led projects were funded as part of a grants program.

The team has also hosted a range of events to stimulate new ideas and introduce new practices to staff.
