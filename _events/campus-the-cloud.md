On the 10th of May 2016 u!magine hosted a symposium exploring strategies to provide laboratory experiments, clinical consultations, and interactive professional practice in an online space. The Campus to the Cloud event was hosted on both the Wagga and Bathurst campuses connected by a large screen video conference.

The Campus and the Cloud Symposium explored and scrutinised a range of online alternatives for many of the campus-based activities that form the core of residential schools. Demonstrations of successful applications of virtual laboratories and online clinical and professional skills practice at CSU and beyond were on show. These demonstrations provided the stimulus for deep discussions that ran throughout the day, specifically about the applicability of these strategies within the CSU distance education context.
