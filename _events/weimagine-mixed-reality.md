    Imagine not having to download and install an app to experience or create Augmented and Virtual experiences, just open a URL and it just works...

    This session will look at how utilising the web to deliver AR and VR educational content removes the initial on-boarding obstacles for the end user, and speeds up and decreases the cost to deliver as it works across various devices, without the need to re-develop for multiple platforms.

    We'll look at what is possible on the web right now and where this is headed over the next 12-18 months as it continues to evolve at a blistering pace.

    Learning

    Cogniss is a low/no-code platform disrupting how we use mobile app technology to solve pressing challenges. It combines a simple visual app building interface with powerful gamification, big data and AR/VR capabilities, allowing anyone without coding knowledge to create sophisticated apps for learning and behaviour change.

    Â Democratising app creation in this way not only amplifies the generation of user data, but when paired with deep learning technology, turns the platform into an intelligent, predictive system with the potential to diagnose learning issues earlier.
