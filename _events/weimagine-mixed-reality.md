- title: The Rise of No-Code Platforms and the Democratisation of App Creation for
    Learning
  start: 2018-08-30 12:00:00 +1000

    Cogniss is a low/no-code platform disrupting how we use mobile app technology to solve pressing challenges. It combines a simple visual app building interface with powerful gamification, big data and AR/VR capabilities, allowing anyone without coding knowledge to create sophisticated apps for learning and behaviour change.

    Â Democratising app creation in this way not only amplifies the generation of user data, but when paired with deep learning technology, turns the platform into an intelligent, predictive system with the potential to diagnose learning issues earlier.
