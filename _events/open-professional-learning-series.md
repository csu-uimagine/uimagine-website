    relatively new and CSU is now an active player in this space. This introductory
    session will discuss the multifaceted open learning and open educational arena
    including: processes (what is open? why is learning now open?); practices (who
    is open? what is the local and global outreach?); and platforms (how are open
    courses designed and where can you find them?). Presented by Julie Lindsay, Val
    Peachey and Leanne White from the u!magine Open Pathways team.  \n  \n**Pre-reading**

    practices. It also explores the benefits and opportunities and challenges of being
    an ‘open’ academic through interaction with CSU practitioners in this space. Open
    Pathways online courses are discussed with a view to encouraging others to be
    involved. Presented by Julie Lindsay, Val Peachey, Leanne White and guest speakers
