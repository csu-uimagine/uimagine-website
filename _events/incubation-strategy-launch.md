  bio: |-
    Jim Groom is the co-founder of [**Reclaim Hosting**](http://reclaimhosting.com/), an independent web hosting company focused on the higher education community.  Previous appointments include Director of the Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies and Adjunct Professor at the [**University of Mary Washington**](http://umw.edu/) in Fredericksburg, Virginia, USA, and adjunct professor positions in American Literature, and Computer Science, English and Museum Studies, as well as instructional technology specialist and fellow positions in a number of New York State universities. 

    Jim has worked for the past twenty years in education with a consistent focus on the development of teaching and learning in higher education, specialising for the past ten years in the field of instructional technology.  His extensive collaborations with faculty and students on curricula, pedagogical and technologically-enhanced projects have informed much of his work on innovative teaching and learning design.  

    Examples include the re-imagining of the Computer Science 106 course on Digital Storytelling at University of Mary Washington as an open, online community referred to as [**ds106**](http://ds106.us/)—an experiment in teaching and learning on the web that is still going strong and has been celebrated internationally as a compelling community-based approach to online learning.  A more recent initiative at UMW is [**A Domain of One’s Own**](http://umwdomains.com/) which began in Fall semester of 2013, where all incoming Freshman were given their own domain and web hosting account, thus providing students with the flexibility to build out their ePortfolio using a variety of software and approaches in a space that gives them the power to easily migrate and transport their ePortfolio data when they graduate. 

    Jim writes regularly about his work as an instructional technologist, in addition to several other interests such as film, literature, and media of all kinds, on his blog [**bavatuesdays**](http://bavatuesdays.com/).
