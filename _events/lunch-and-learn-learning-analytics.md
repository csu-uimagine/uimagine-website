    Dashboards provide a way to visualise student engagement in Interact2 subject sites. Hear about the development of a dashboard for the Lecturers in Learning and Teaching, Faculty of Arts & Education, and how it can be used to determine how student engagement relates to the design of subject sites.

    Kath Herbert, Lecturer in Learning and Teaching, Faculty of Arts & Education, will describe how she uses the dashboard to talk to academics about i2 site engagement and i2 site design.

    In the Q&A segment you will not only have the chance to ask questions of Ian and Kath, but you can suggest your own visualisations or data you’d like to see to help examine and improve your teaching and your students’ learning.

    Interact2 Online Tests are used extensively as part of the learning design for many subjects to measure student knowledge and gauge progress. The effectiveness of online tests can be checked by using Item Analysis. Item Analysis provides statistics on overall individual performances and test performance. This data helps you recognise questions that might be poor discriminators of student performance.

    These insights go towards improving questions for future test administrations and can provide the basis for supplementary or developmental content.

u!magine and [Adaptive Learning and Teaching Services](http://www.csu.edu.au/division/learning-and-teaching/home/analytics-and-evaluations) are running their **Lunch & Learn: Building your Analytics Toolbox** series in June, with an additional session featuring Blackboard Test Analytics.

Each session will begin at 12.30pm using the format – 10 min presentation of functionality, 10 min academic practitioner, followed by a 10 min Q&A. These sessions are designed to help academics build their analytics toolbox by exploring the ways specific CSU systems can be used to inform teaching and learning, and showcase the practical ways these are already being used by some academics.
